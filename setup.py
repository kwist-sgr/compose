Unsupported Python version
==========================
This version of Compose requires Python {}.{}, but you're trying to
install it on Python {}.{}.
This may be because you are using a version of pip that doesn't
understand the python_requires classifier. Make sure you
have pip >= 9.0 and setuptools >= 24.2, then try again:
    $ python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
    $ python -m pip install python-compose
This will install the latest version of Compose which works on your version of Python.
